# Overview

The **Web Components SDK** provides Pega customers with the ability to build DX components that connect Pegaâ€™s ConstellationJS Engine APIs with a design system other than the Constellation design system.

The alternative design system used in this Web Components SDK is based on
[Lion web components](https://lion-web.netlify.app/), which are open-source components that are designed to be extended and flexibly integrated with other components. The Lion web components are built with [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide)
and [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/guide).

# Prerequisites

## Pega Infinity Server and Constellation-enabled Application

This version of the Web Components SDK assumes that you have access to a Pega Infinity server (**'24.2 GA and later versions**) running an application that is configured to run using the Constellation UI service.

The **MediaCo** sample application is already configured as a Constellation architecture-based application and can be found in the Web Components SDK download associated with this repo which is available at the [Marketplace page](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/web-components-sdk). The OAuth 2.0 Client Registration records associated with the **MediaCo** application are available in the same Web Components SDK download. For more information about the MediaCo sample application, see [MediaCo sample application](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/mediaco-sample-application.html).

The **Web Components SDK** has been tested with:
- node 20.12.1
- npm 10.5.0

Future updates to the SDK will support more recent LTS versions of node as the Constellation architecture supports them.
